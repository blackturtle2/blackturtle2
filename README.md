🚀 I'm swimming in a side project called `Red Calendar`.  
📱 `Red Calendar` has more than 10,000 daily active users.  
⭐️ `Red Calendar` has over 350 user reviews and a rating of 4.0+! (As of September 2020)  
🧑🏻‍💻 I'm developing on the `Red Calendar` project, and doing design, planning, and QA all by myself.

🔭 I’m currently working on Streami.  
🧑🏻‍🏫 I have taught Project Management at "Fast Campus" and at some public institutions.  
💻 I gave general knowledge of development to non-majors such as PM/planner/designer.
