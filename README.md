🚀 I'm swimming in a side project called `Red Calendar`.  
📱 `Red Calendar` has more than **50,000 daily active users**.  
⭐️ `Red Calendar` has over **30,000 user reviews** and a rating of 4.0+! ( As of 2024 year )  
🧑🏻‍💻 I'm developing on the `Red Calendar` project, and doing design, planning, and QA **all by myself**.
