🚀 I'm swimming in a side project called `Red Calendar`. [<img src="https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/images/badge-download-on-the-app-store.svg" alt="Go to App Store">](https://apps.apple.com/kr/app/%EB%B9%A8%EA%B0%84%EB%8B%AC%EB%A0%A5-2020/id1489018103)  
📱 `Red Calendar` has more than 10,000 daily active users.  
⭐️ `Red Calendar` has over 350 user reviews and a rating of 4.0+! (As of September 2020)  
🧑🏻‍💻 I'm developing on the `Red Calendar` project, and doing design, planning, and QA all by myself.
